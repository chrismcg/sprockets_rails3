= Engineered

Rails 3 engine will be "engineered" when you can include gem into your
application Gemfile without much extra work, maintenance or conflicts. 

"Engineered" provides some groundwork for this scenario such as common 
app/stylesheets and app/javascripts in your engine what will be compiled
into your master application public directory using Sass and Sprockets.
